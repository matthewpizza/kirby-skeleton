## FAQ

### Why not use the Kirby Starterkit?

This project is inspired by [Kirby Starterkit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit), but aims to improve upon it by removing the need to keep the Kirby source files on version control in your project. This will benefit you with a cleaner repo as well as making upgrades to future releases easier.

### What is Composer?

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP. It is used in this project to install and update Kirby. To get started with Composer, checkout the [installation documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

### Where is the panel?

The [Kirby Panel](https://github.com/getkirby/panel) will be added to the skeleton in a future release.
